For propositional logic, it may be shown that semantic consequence 
⊨
{\displaystyle \models } and derivability 
⊢
{\displaystyle \vdash } are equivalent to one-another. That is, propositional logic is sound (
⊢
{\displaystyle \vdash } implies 
⊨
{\displaystyle \models }) and complete (
⊨
{\displaystyle \models } implies 
⊢
{\displaystyle \vdash })
